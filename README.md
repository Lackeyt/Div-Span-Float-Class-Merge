#### By _**Tyson Lackey**_

## Description

_Based on day 2 lessons, I created a mock up webpage using the elements covered (Float, div, span, inline elements, branching, merging, etc.). output available at: https://lackeyt.github.io/Div-Span-Float-Class-Merge/_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Create .git folder in the project folder/directory
* Create a github repository
* Create an img subfolder in the project directory to store images locally
* Open the project in Visual Studio

## Known Bugs

* Images in the float elements are hard coded to pixel dimensions but the background is a relative %, this causes incosistencies when the window is resized.
